            Support for threads may be provided either at the user level, for
            user threads, or by the kernel, for kernel threads. User threads are
            supported above the kernel and are managed without kernel support,
            whereas kernel threads are supported and managed directly by the
            operating system. Virtually all contemporary operating
            systems—including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and Solaris— support
            kernel threads. Ultimately, a relationship must exist between user
            threads and kernel threads. In this section, we look at three common
            ways of establishing such a relationship: the many-to-one model, the
            one-to-one model, and the many-to-many model.

            The many-to-one model maps many user-level threads to one kernel
            thread. Thread management is done by the thread library in user
            space, so it is efficient. However, the entire process will block if
            a thread makes a blocking system call. Also, because only one thread
            can access the kernel at a time, multiple threads are unable to run
            in parallel on multicore systems. Green threads—a thread library
            available for Solaris systems and adopted in early versions of
            Java—used the many-to-one model. However, very few systems continue
            to use the model because of its inability to take advantage of
            multiple processing cores.

            The one-to-one model maps each user thread to a kernel thread. It
            provides more concurrency than the many-to-one model by allowing
            another thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call. It
            also allows multiple threads to run in parallel on multiprocessors.
            The only drawback to this model is that creating a user thread
            requires creating the corresponding kernel thread. Because the
            overhead of creating kernel threads can burden the performance of an
            application, most implementations of this model restrict the number
            of threads supported by the system. Linux, along with the family of
            Windows operating systems, implement the one-to-one model.

            The many-to-many model multiplexes many user-level threads to a
            smaller or equal number of kernel threads. The number of kernel
            threads may be specific to either a particular application or a
            particular machine (an application may be allocated more kernel
            threads on a multiprocessor than on a single processor).<br />
            Let’s consider the effect of this design on concurrency. Whereas the
            many to-one model allows the developer to create as many user
            threads as she wishes, it does not result in true concurrency,
            because the kernel can schedule only one thread at a time. The
            one-to-one model allows greater concurrency, but the developer has
            to be careful not to create too many threads within an application
            (and in some instances may be limited in the number of threads she
            can create). <br />The many-to-many model suffers from neither of
            these shortcomings: developers can create as many user threads as
            necessary, and the corresponding kernel threads can run in parallel
            on a multiprocessor. Also, when a thread performs a blocking system
            call, the kernel can schedule another thread for execution.

            Pthreads refers to the POSIX standard defining an API for thread
            creation and synchronization. This is a specification for thread
            behavior, not an implementation. Operating-system designers may
            implement the specification in any way they wish. Numerous systems
            implement the Pthreads specification; most are UNIX-type systems,
            including Linux, Mac OS X, and Solaris. Although Windows doesn’t
            support Pthread natively, some third party implementaions are
            available.<br />The C program shown below demonstrates the basic
            Pthreads API for constructing a multithreaded program that
            calculates the summation of a non negative integer in a separate
            thread. In a Pthreads program, separate threads begin execution in a
            specified function. When this program begins, a single thread of
            control begins in main(). After some initialization, main() creates
            a second thread that begins control in the runner() function. Both
            threads share the global data sum. <br />
            This example program creates only a single thread. With the growing
            dominance of multicore systems, writing programs containing several
            threads has become increasingly common. A simple method for waiting
            on several threads using the pthread join() function is to enclose
            the operation within a simple for loop.
